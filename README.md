# CS360-Final-Project

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The goal of the app was to design an inventory app that allowed users to add and update items to a database for their needs. The app is unfinished currently.

  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI     designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  The screens included explicit options for interaction and easily read data to effectively navigate and use the app. It would have been easy to login, add, edit or delete items, and turn on and off SMS messaging for out of stock items.
  
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  My approach centered on what was needed for each screen of the project to be successful. This led me to focus much more on what each requirement asked of me as the developer to best suit the users needs.
  
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  The code that was most functional was the login screen. The process of testing it repeatedly showed me that a modular approach to the problem of indiviual interactions made the process easier to follow and more effecient.

  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  In the login screen, I was using a lot of code repeatedly to accomplish the same goal, so creating a method for repeated process made the code much easier to understand.

  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  As it stands, this would be the login screen as it is fully capable of creating users and checking users against its database.
